Tuesday Thoughts taking to time to transmit
Transform from the the patterns visualize
 bit by bit
Techniques harness from where you find fit
To match the fire inside
to make sure it is lit
Split between the vessels
As what makes you special
Rises by the level
Manifestation from post notions
That seem to come out of the script
From the stencil
You derive from your internal
External view 
That you have chosen
On this tuesday, what is your potion?
How will you describe your motion?
Which dreams have you spoken?
Which emotions are unbroken?


Cyborgs imprinting
Verifying of the hearts are matching
Listening and Responding
To the voltage spikes from the plugs
Making sure the electricity doesn't scrubbed
And the feelings attached aren't subbed 
With a desire for what is within
What what their bodies inspire
Hoping the circuitry isnt expired
For these are well received notions
For our communications
Only for us
This is our nutrition
 Not just for mind and body
Bot for the soul and the passion
And how all this is process
Process in the interactions
Voltmeter cupping the circuits through the breast
Circling the neck, 
measuring the pressure in the rest
As the bound tightens for the mind to study
For what makes one tick
What makes one endure past their limits
What makes one flourish past their pivots
And dissolve the unnecessary erosion
Done so wildly
But the maintenances shall check
For the plug might need to be inspect
But always and always with respect

Creative Production is a journey of successes
And failures that aren't quite failures
But additional tools to add to the processes
Experiences and senses
As in this stream of life
We are sailors
Trying to convey the message
Across the many seas
Many dreams
Many streams that can be produce
Sometimes to be used
Other times to be reduced
With a notion to introduce
Induce , seduce, deduce
As we the creative roots
We plant
May bear fruit
For participants and audience alike
Adding statement such as
Code is poetry, poetry is code
And equations are all around us
For the mind to get a different story to roam
Different perspective that when being told
Can warm the edges
Of scenarios that are may than just cold
Provided more than just a slant
Even the potentiality of a memory to enchant
All of this to note
Some parts to quote
Being a creative producer
To me is playing with the world
Experiment in its hurl
Strengthen out 1 or 2 curls
Itching to see what can be a referral

For a story that hasn't been written
But is far from hidden
