For this month has reached the middle
Providing a fairshare of riddles
squibbles,  signals and swivels
But let's keep our flow simple
Simple as our interactions
Mingles and nibble
To feed our actions
That will seed our passion
For the goals, we dream
Would be seen through the extractions
Even if it starts in fractions
It will lead to the whole, we see
To the dreams,, we seek
To the growth , we reach
From our core, that is within deep
How will the other half of this timeline,
Be intertwine, with what your mind
Desires to be aligned?
