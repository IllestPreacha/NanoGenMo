Vast spread from end to end
Through barren grainy lands encompasses a traverse through this harsh wasteland

Covered by Horus grace 
Wild runs Rhonso jogs on frolics 

Not all seen is as it seems
Beams dim when Osiris’ agents present presents top floor

Nonetheless the freshness of Nomoli 
Quench the thirst from Horus vex

Here resides the Manoian
A people left after the Great Clash
Governed by gods West to North
Caught in a vice heavy prices paid
Remains laid carcasses displayed around out bounds

Invisible dome protect
crops inspect
looking for a moment not to disrespect
as all eyes are watching
the desert is prowling
deciding which crop it should be snatching
carry in batches while in
styling
to wander into the desert
with the sand towards the eyes
acting like a flirt
a pest that is blocking your line
hindering your ability to be alert
wandering takes alot of energy to exert

Covered by Horus grace 
Wild runs Rhonso jogs on frolics 

Not all seen is as it seems
Beams dim when Osiris’ agents present presents top floor

Nonetheless the freshness of Nomoli 
Quench the thirst from Horus vex
